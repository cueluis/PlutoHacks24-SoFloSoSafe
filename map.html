      This is a map to broadcast where and how far the effects of the natural
      disasters have reached. Aside from the natural disaster, it will also show
      where different essential services are. This includes a gas can showing
      where gasoline can be found, a bag to show where you can get access to
      grocery stores and reliable food, a house to show where shelter is, a
      water bottle for where freshwater can be found, a plus for healthcare
      providers, and a G for government assistance. This will be represented
      based on user suggestions so that it is more up to date.
